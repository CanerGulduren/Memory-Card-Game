# Game Rules
+ The game starts with clicking on a card.
+ The card that you clicked on will reveal a picture by turning over.
+ If the card you clicked on matches with the next card you click, it stays face-up.
+ However, if they do not match, it turns back over and you lose one of your limited attempts.
+ If you can match all the cards before your attempts run out, you win the game.
